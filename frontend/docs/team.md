### How would be the team structure ?
- A user can create a team and define a team name.

- The user creating the team is automatically designated the team lead.

- The team must have a minimum of 2 members and a maximum of 5 members to be officially created.

- The team lead can invite other users (using their unique username) to join the team.

- A unique team ID is generated by the system upon creation.
